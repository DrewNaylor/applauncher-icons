# applauncher-icons

applauncher-icons is a project which contains most of the icons used in Drew's App Launcher ([32-bit](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/MSOfficeAppLauncherNext32) &bull; [64-bit](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/MSOfficeAppLauncherNext64)) and [UXL Launcher](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher). This project excludes application branding icons and banners designed specifically for both of those aforementioned projects.

If you want the source of the icons in the "Complicated" folder then here are the sources that I found the clipart. Note that I combined the clipart together to make the icons. I made the icons in the "Simple" folder all on my own.

This isn't technically clipart but it might be interesting:

I went online and seached for open-source clipart and I found the Open Clipart website which allows people to do whatever they want with the clipart. See this page: https://openclipart.org/may-clipart-be-used-comparison
