# applauncher-icons

Latest version: https://github.com/DrewNaylor/applauncher-icons/releases/latest

applauncher-icons is a project which contains most of the icons used in Drew's App Launcher ([32-bit](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/MSOfficeAppLauncherNext32) &bull; [64-bit](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/MSOfficeAppLauncherNext64)) and [UXL Launcher](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher). This project excludes application branding icons and banners designed specifically for both of those aforementioned projects.

[applauncher-icons version 2.0](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/applauncher-icons/releases/tag/v2.0) is the first version to be licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. If you want to use icons from applauncher-icons with the CC BY 4.0 license in your own application or project, simply state that you are using applauncher-icons version 2.0, along with the required attribution information. However, if you don't say that you're using version 2.0, the previous license will apply because that was the license that was used when [applauncher-icons version 1.0](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/applauncher-icons/releases/tag/v1.0) was released. You don't need to use applauncher-icons version 2.0 if you don't want to. None of the actual icons have been changed between 1.0 and 2.0.

If you want the source of the icons in the "Complicated" folder then here are the sources that I (Drew Naylor) found the clipart. Note that I combined the clipart together to make the icons. I made the icons in the "Simple" folder all on my own using GIMP's Blend tool.

This isn't technically clipart but it might be interesting:

I went online and seached for open-source clipart and I found the Open Clipart website which allows people to do whatever they want with the clipart. See this page: https://openclipart.org/may-clipart-be-used-comparison

I actually made the border and the filling color for the Picture Manager icon, as well as the text on the Language Settings icon.

Microsoft is not associated with either the applauncher-icons project or Drew Naylor and does not condone this project.
