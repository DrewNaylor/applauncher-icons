*"You" is the end user and "I" or "Me" is Drew Naylor.*

You may do whatever you want with the icons in both the "Simple" folder and the "Complicated" folder as long as you credit Drew Naylor with creating the icons and you don't sell the icons or use them to defame me. If you want the source of the icons in the "Complicated" folder then look in the README file. Note that I combined the clipart together to make the icons. I made the icons in the "Simple" folder all on my own.
